Deploying Jenkins on AWS
1. First Create an ubuntu EC2 instance.
2. Then, open terminal if using mac otherwise we can install MobaXtream or putty for windows.
3. In terminal, type
                  sudo apt update # used for update the package lists for packages that need upgrading, as well as new packages that have just come to the repositories
4. Then to access the ubuntu using third party(terminal or MobaXtream or putty) which we have created using Ec2, type 
                  ssh -i pemfilename.pem ubuntu@publicipadress
5. To deploy jenkins, first we have to install java
                  sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
6. Then to install jenkins,
                  sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
                  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io-2023.key
                  echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc]" \
                  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee \
                  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
                  sudo apt-get update
                  sudo apt-get install jenkins
7. Then, got to aws ec2 instance later to security->security groups->edit inbound rules. In ibound rules add another one and set type as custom TCP, port range as 80:80 and source as Anywhere in the world-IPv4. Then click on save rules.
8. After finishing all these, open a new tab and type
                  https://publiidaddress:80:80
9. Here, 80:80 means that you are mapping port 80 of the host machine to port 80 of the Jenkins container. This allows you to access Jenkins by navigating to http://localhost:80:80 on your web browser.
10. Then to open the jenkins, copy the code on to the terminal and type "cat code" , then you will get a password.
11. Copy that password and enter into the web browser, then you can able to access the jenkins server.
